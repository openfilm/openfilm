 * edit is sent to be written, one request at a time, each against the revision the last one produced. When the
 * server answers that the film moved on without it (the agent removed the clip), the film here becomes the server's;
 * so it does when the folder's film, once every edit here is written, is not the one here (the agent wrote it a moment
 * before, and the server applied the edit on top). A film.html that cannot be read (the agent is halfway through
 * writing it, or wrote it wrong) is `broken`: the film here stays as it last was, and edits wait for it to be whole.
 *
 * Undo and redo are edits too, worked out by clip id from the film before and after (`inverse`), so undoing a move
 * puts that clip back without putting back what the agent changed meanwhile.
