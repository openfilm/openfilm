/**
 * The picture: the film's timeline page (film.html played by src/timeline.mjs, with Studio's bridge and stage) on the film's own origin,
 * scaled to fit. The editor tells it which moment to draw and what changed; it says when the moment is on screen and
 * what is under a point. The stage (studio/server/stage.js) answers the picture-area
 * editing's questions (`stage`) and tells of an in-place text edit ending and of keys pressed in the picture.
 *
 * An edit is applied to the page in place (a move, a trim, a volume, a tweak, clips added or removed: a split, a
 * paste, a drop, a delete, and another stage size), what it puts on screen made ready out of sight first
 * (src/timeline.mjs); only another head of the film (its styles), a page or file it uses changed on disk, or a clip that cannot load, loads the film again, in a
 * second, hidden frame that replaces the shown one once its first picture is drawn whole (its videos loaded, however
 * long that takes), and is told the edits made meanwhile. Either way the picture never goes black for an edit.
