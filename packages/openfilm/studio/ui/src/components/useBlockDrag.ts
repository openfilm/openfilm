/**
 * Dragging on the timeline: a clip moved (or copied, ⌥), an edge trimmed, a speed changed by an edge. Press, follow the
 * pointer, write the result to film.html on release.
 *
 * Clips are a projection of the evaluated film, not data to change freely: release sends an edit and the timeline
 * redraws from the film that comes back. Two consequences:
 *   · while dragging only the local preview changes — a drag is hundreds of pointer moves;
 *   · after release the clips stay where they were let go until the new layout arrives, instead of jumping back
 *     first (which looks like a failed drag).
 *
 * What a gesture does to the other clips is planned by lib/timeline-edit (the main track's magnet, linkage, linked
 * clips), every frame, so the clips it pushes or carries are drawn where they will be before release; release sends
 * that plan, one write and one undo step.
 *
 * The idle / pending / dragging gesture with a 5 px threshold follows mature editors: without it, clicking a clip
 * would be a zero-length drag that writes the same value back.
