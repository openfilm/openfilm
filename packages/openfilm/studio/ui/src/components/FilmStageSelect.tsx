/**
 * Pointing at things in the picture: hover outlines, click and marquee selection, the transform handles, nudging,
 * typing a line in place, and the context menus.
 *
 * Two kinds of selection, each with its own way in:
 *
 * A **whole clip** (a frame with handles: move, scale, turn) is selected on the **timeline**: one block selected there
 * is in hand here. Clicking the picture does not pick a clip up, so pressing and dragging on the picture is never
 * "drag a clip away" and the marquee has somewhere to happen.
 *
 * A **layer inside a clip** is selected on the **picture**: with no clip in hand, the layer under the pointer (a line
 * of text, a picture, an SVG shape, a box that paints) is outlined; a click selects it and the inspector shows its
 * sections. Where several are stacked the smallest wins (the word, not the card); Alt-click again goes one down.
 * Empty shells that only place things are passed over.
 *
 * With nothing in hand, pressing and dragging draws a marquee; a click and a marquee part only when the pointer is let
 * go (further than the threshold: a marquee). Esc drops the selection.
 *
 * With ⌘ held (Ctrl on Windows), when the app around Studio has a chat (`onRegion`), a box drawn on the picture points
 * at that part of it in the chat instead: nothing is selected, the box flashes and is handed on with what is in it.
 *
 * A whole clip's frame, its handles and its snapping go by the part of it that shows (what its crop leaves). A video or
 * still in hand is cropped in place (C, a double-click on it, or the inspector's Crop): the whole picture shows with
 * what is cut away darkened, the crop's handles move its edges, a drag inside pans; Enter keeps it (written once, as
 * the clip's own `clip-path: inset(…)` and `object-position`), Esc gives it up.
 *
 * With something in hand, holding Alt over another clip or layer measures the distances to it (over nothing, or over
 * itself, to the stage's edges).
 *
 * The film runs on its own origin: everything about its DOM (what is under a point, where a layer is drawn, showing
 * a change before it is kept, the in-place text box) is asked of the film's stage through the picture's handle
 * (Preview `stage`, studio/server/stage.js). Hover asks at most once a frame, one question at a time, the latest
 * point winning. What is written is always film.html: a clip's `box`, a page's `overrides`, through the callbacks.
