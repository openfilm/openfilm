/**
 * Where `openfilm get` gets media from: services the person connects with their own key, each paid directly, with the
 * model the person chose for each kind of media. Each provider is a module
 * whose default export is a `Provider`; `get.mjs` picks one per verb (`--via`, else the person's choice in Settings;
 * nothing is picked for them) and lands what it returns in the project.
 *
 * Verbs (the same flags whoever serves them; a provider takes the ones it can honor and says so for the rest):
 *   voice         list voices                  --language --gender --prompt --limit
 *   tts           voice-over                   --out --text --voice
 *   sfx           sound effect                 --out --prompt --sec
 *   music         music                        --out --prompt --sec
 *   asr           transcribe a project file    --src --force
 *   image-search  find pictures on the web     --out --prompt --n
 *   image         make a picture               --out --prompt --ratio --quality --transparent
 *   video         make a video clip            --out --prompt --duration --aspect-ratio --first-frame --last-frame
 *                                              --input-reference
 *   web-search    search the web               --query (up to 3)
 *   web-fetch     read web pages               --url (up to 3)
 * and `translate` (subtitles: `{ lines, language }` → translated lines), which is not a CLI verb. Its args also carry
 * the voice it comes from (`src`, `text`, `words`, `dur`) and each line's `times` ({ startSec, endSec }); the lines come
 * back as `receipt.lines`, one string per line asked.
