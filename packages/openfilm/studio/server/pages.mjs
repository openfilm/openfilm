/**
 * The film's origin: the projects' files, read only, on a port of their own. The preview's pages, pictures and sounds
 * load from here, so a web page (code an agent wrote) runs on another origin than the editor: it cannot read the
 * editor, its cookie or its API. Every project shares this one origin, each under a token of its own (`/p/<token>/…`).
 * The token is the project's id signed with Studio's key: a page cannot work out another project's address, and it is
 * the same after Studio restarts (with the machine's key, see studioKey), so a page left open keeps drawing its film
 * from the address it has. That is all that keeps projects apart: they are not isolated from each other. Pages of
 * every project share the origin's storage (localStorage, IndexedDB, caches), and a page can reach another project's
 * pages open at the same time (and learn its address from them).
 *
 * Only the film's own files are served: no dot file or folder (`.film/`, `.git/`, `.env`), no name with a `:` (a
 * Windows stream), nothing a link leads to out of the folder. Only requests addressed to 127.0.0.1, localhost or
 * [::1] at this port are answered (ownHost).
 *
 * Pages get the host flag (the film's clock, see src/host.mjs) before any of their scripts, as `look` and `render`
 * give it, so a film draws here exactly as it renders. Everything may be read by the editor's origin (its sound mixer
 * fetches the media), and pages may be framed only by it. A media file asked for with `?film-sound` is its sound,
 * small (derived.mjs soundOf): what the mixer plays, never the whole of a video; 204 when it has none.
