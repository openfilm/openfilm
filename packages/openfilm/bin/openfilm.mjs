  open: `openfilm open [folder | url]

  folder   a new film: a folder named after it (made if missing); or an existing project
           A folder that is not a project yet gets an empty film.html, 1920 × 1080 (its viewport <meta>) with no
           tracks; nothing else is created. Not a code project
           (package.json, Cargo.toml, go.mod, pyproject.toml…): the film gets a folder of its own inside it.
  url      a film on GitHub or GitLab: a repository (https://github.com/owner/repo) or a folder in one
           (…/tree/main/<folder>), copied into the projects library without its git history, then opened
  without  the project around the current folder, else the one opened last, else Studio's projects (where the
           person can start one). The current folder is never made a project: name it (.) for that.

  Starts OpenFilm Studio if it is not running and prints its address. A Studio page already open, in any browser,
  switches to the project, and nothing more opens; otherwise open the address in your built-in browser, and if no
  page connects within 15 s, Studio opens the person's browser (OPENFILM_NO_BROWSER=1: never).`,
  skills: `openfilm skills

  The skills the project around the current folder can be made with: ways of making a kind of film, each a folder with
  a SKILL.md (its name, what it is for, how to work) and the files it brings. Looked for in the project's skills/,
  then yours (Skills/ beside the projects, ~/Movies/OpenFilm/Skills on macOS), then the official ones; the first
  holding a name wins.`,
  skill: `openfilm skill <name>
openfilm skill add <GitHub address | folder>
openfilm skill remove <name>

  <name>   print the skill: where its files are, and its SKILL.md whole
  add      add a skill (or a folder of skills) to yours: a folder on this computer, or a repository or a folder in one
           on github.com or gitlab.com, fetched without its git history. One of the same name goes to the trash.
  remove   move one of yours to the trash, where you can take it back

  Yours are kept in Skills/ beside the projects (~/Movies/OpenFilm/Skills on macOS; OPENFILM_SKILLS names another).`,
  update: `openfilm update

  The newest OpenFilm from npm, and Studio started again on it once nothing is being exported or made; pages open on
  it come back on the new version. The desktop app's Studio updates with the app, a source checkout with git pull:
  each is said instead.`,
  doctor: `openfilm doctor

  Checks what OpenFilm needs here and prints a report to paste into an issue: OpenFilm's and Node's versions, the
  system, which agent ran the command, Studio, ffmpeg, the browser films are drawn in and its graphics, the data and
  projects folders, npm, and the last errors in Studio's log. Paths under your home folder read ~; no keys, accounts
  or projects are in it. Exit status 1 when something needs fixing; the report says what.`,
  look: `openfilm look [what] [t | a-b]

  what   the project (default), a web page (.html), or a media file (video, image, sound)
  t      one frame at full size, e.g. 4.5
  a-b    a dense sheet of a stretch, e.g. 3-6
         without either: a contact sheet of the whole thing, its sound and loudness, and a check that
         the same t draws the same picture

  Writes PNGs under .film/cache/look/ of the project and prints their paths. A project Studio has not shown yet is
  opened in Studio first, so the person watches it.

  --count <n>     frames in a sheet (12)`,
  render: `openfilm render [a-b]

  Render the project around the current folder to video.
  The whole film goes to <project>/<folder name>.mp4, beside film.html; a range (a-b) goes to .film/cache/render/.
  A project Studio has not shown yet is opened in Studio first.

  --out <file>    another path; .webm or .mov with --alpha
  --fps <n>       frame rate, including decimals such as 29.97 (30)
  --4k            3840 px wide              --scale <n>     any device pixel ratio
  --blur          motion blur (8 samples)   --samples <n>   --shutter <0..1>
  --alpha         transparent background    --workers <n>   parallel browsers
  --subtitles     burn the project's subtitles in, in their own style`,
