# Contributing

Thanks for helping. Issues and pull requests are welcome. Everything here runs on your machine with your own keys:
nothing else is needed to run it, change it or test it.

## Quick start

You need Node 22.18 or later (the tests run TypeScript directly), pnpm 9 (`corepack enable` gives you the version
this repository names in package.json), ffmpeg on the PATH, and git.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/openfilm/openfilm && cd openfilm
pnpm install                 # also builds Studio's editor (packages/openfilm: build:ui)
pnpm --filter openfilm exec playwright-core install chromium-headless-shell
pnpm dev                     # Studio from this checkout, with a sample film
pnpm test
```

From the root:

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm dev` | Studio from source (packages/openfilm's `dev`), apart from an installed OpenFilm |
| `pnpm dev:desktop` | the desktop app from source, as "OpenFilm Dev" |
| `pnpm test` | every package's tests |
| `pnpm typecheck` | every package's types |
| `pnpm build` | Studio's editor and the desktop app's window |
| `pnpm audit:public` | what must not be in a public repository: secrets (gitleaks), home folders, paths out of the repository, prose in another language than English outside the translations, dependencies outside this workspace |
| `pnpm check:pack` | packs `openfilm` as npm would get it, lists its files and checks them |
| `pnpm changeset` | adds a changeset to your pull request (below, Releases) |

`pnpm --filter <package> <script>` runs one package's script; the packages are `openfilm`, `@openfilm/shared` and
`@openfilm/desktop`.

## packages/openfilm: the format, the CLI and Studio

`pnpm dev` runs Studio on port 4848, with its state and exports in `packages/openfilm/.dev/` (git-ignored), beside an
OpenFilm you have installed; its projects are in the library every OpenFilm shares. It opens a sample film in your browser, rebuilds the editor
when `studio/ui` changes (reload the page), and restarts Studio when `studio/server` or `src` change. Ctrl+C stops it.

`pnpm --filter openfilm test` runs its tests and `pnpm --filter openfilm typecheck` checks the server's and the
editor's types. One file, or one test in it, from `packages/openfilm`:

```sh
node --test src/film-doc.test.mjs
node --test --test-name-pattern="split" studio/server/film.test.mjs
```

### Trying a change with a coding agent

While `pnpm dev` runs, `packages/openfilm/.dev/bin/openfilm` (`openfilm.cmd` on Windows) is your checkout's command
on that Studio. Ask Codex, Claude Code or any coding agent for a film and tell it to run that command instead of the
skill's `npx -y openfilm@latest` (the release); the manual names the same command, so it keeps using it. Your films
appear in the Studio `pnpm dev` opened. Its state is in `packages/openfilm/.dev/` and its port is its own, so an
installed OpenFilm, its Studio on port 4747 and `~/.openfilm` are left alone; projects are the one thing they share:
every OpenFilm uses the same library, the one Studio's Settings chose (kept in `~/.openfilm/prefs.json`, which
`OPENFILM_SHARED_HOME` points it at), by default `~/Movies/OpenFilm/Projects` on macOS. A test that must stay apart
sets `OPENFILM_LIBRARY` and leaves `OPENFILM_SHARED_HOME` unset.

To make your checkout the `openfilm` your agents use everywhere, `npm link` in `packages/openfilm` (`npm unlink -g
openfilm` undoes it). That one shares `~/.openfilm` and port 4747 with an installed OpenFilm; of two Studios, the
newer version replaces the older.

## packages/shared: what the clients share

`@openfilm/shared` holds what the desktop app's chat reads: a chat turn and its events, how an agent's activity
reads, prompt references, title limits and Markdown parsing.

`pnpm --filter @openfilm/shared test`, `pnpm --filter @openfilm/shared typecheck`. It is not published: the
workspace reads its TypeScript in `src/` as it is, and the desktop app bundles it.

## apps/desktop: the desktop app

```sh
pnpm dev:desktop                              # builds the window's page, then runs the app as "OpenFilm Dev"
pnpm --filter @openfilm/desktop test
pnpm --filter @openfilm/desktop typecheck
```

Run from source, the app is its own "OpenFilm Dev": its own name, data folder, Studio home and port, so it never
shares a window or a Studio with an installed OpenFilm. Its projects are in the same library as every OpenFilm's.
Its renamed copy of Electron lives in `apps/desktop/.dev/` (git-ignored), signed only for this machine: you need no
certificate to run or change it. Its window's page imports Studio's editor
from `packages/openfilm` as source, so a change to Studio shows in the app at its next start.

`pnpm --filter @openfilm/desktop release` builds an installable app into `apps/desktop/.release/` (git-ignored),
unsigned unless `OPENFILM_SIGN_IDENTITY` and `APPLE_TEAM_ID` are set. A build you make is yours to try; before you
distribute one, read [TRADEMARK.md](TRADEMARK.md): a fork published as its own needs its own name and icon.

## The update feed and product.json

`packages/openfilm/product.json` says where the desktop app looks for updates. It is empty in the repository, so a
desktop build of your own never looks for them. The official feed is in `product.official.json`; the package npm
publishes and the official desktop app carry it. Media services are connected with your own keys: in Studio,
Settings → Providers, or each service's variable in the environment (`ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, …).

## Releases

Every pull request that changes what a package's users get carries a **changeset**: run `pnpm changeset`, pick the
packages it changes (`openfilm`, `@openfilm/desktop`, `@openfilm/shared`) and how much (`patch` for a fix, `minor`
for something new; `major` only by agreement), and write a line for the changelog, as a user would read it. Commit the
file it writes in `.changeset/`. A change to tests, docs or CI alone needs none (`pnpm changeset --empty` says so).
Each line in the changelog links its pull request and thanks its author.

All the packages share one version. When changesets reach `main`, the release workflow opens a "Version packages"
pull request that bumps it and writes the changelogs; merging it publishes `openfilm` to npm (with provenance, from CI
only). Then a maintainer pushes the tag `v<version>`: the desktop workflow builds the app, signs and notarizes it, and
makes a draft GitHub release with the installers. Publishing that release makes it the latest, which the website's
download links and the apps' update checks follow.

## Where to start

Issues labeled `good first issue` are small and say what is needed; `help wanted` ones are bigger. Say on the issue
that you are taking it, and open one before starting a large change, so nobody does it twice. Questions go to
[Discussions](https://github.com/openfilm/openfilm/discussions).

## What we keep small

- **The manual** ([MANUAL.md](packages/openfilm/MANUAL.md)), what `openfilm` prints for agents, holds three things:
  what a film is, the one rule (the picture depends only on t), and how the tools are used. No style advice or
  methods. If an agent gets something wrong, a word is added only when the manual was ambiguous; if a tool behaved
  oddly, the tool is fixed.
- **The format** ([SPEC.md](packages/openfilm/SPEC.md)): a new attribute of `film.html` is read in one place,
  [src/film-doc.mjs](packages/openfilm/src/film-doc.mjs), and described in the spec in the same pull request.
- **No adapters.** Pages use the web as it is; libraries load from pinned public CDNs.

## Adding a media provider

### Which services are built in

A built-in provider reads as a service OpenFilm vouches for: people hand it their keys, their prompts and their
footage. So we hold one standard for every one:

- **An internationally known company, or a leading name in its field**, offering **its own** service (its own models,
  its own index, its own voices). These can be proposed directly.
- **Any other service** is welcome to show it belongs: open an issue first, before writing code, with material on
  - **scale**: the requests it serves, the customers or products that rely on it;
  - **stability**: its uptime, how long it has run, how it announces changes and retires models;
  - **privacy and security**: what it keeps of a request, for how long, where, and who can see it (its policy,
    links to it).

  We look at it with you, and say yes or no with the reason before you spend time on a pull request.
- **A service that resells or routes other companies' models** is not built in, however good its API: those models
  reach OpenFilm through their makers, or through a provider that is already built in.

Every service, built in or not, works with OpenFilm today through **Settings › Providers › Custom services**: any
HTTP service with its address, a key if it has one, and a few words about it; the agent calls it from there, and the
key stays on the computer.

### What its pull request comes with

A provider is one file in [studio/server/providers/](packages/openfilm/studio/server/providers/) that keeps the
contract in `contract.mjs`, listed in `OWN` in `index.mjs`; [groq.mjs](packages/openfilm/studio/server/providers/groq.mjs)
is a small one to start from. Its pull request comes with:

- **Tests against a fake service** on 127.0.0.1, as `groq.test.mjs` does: what is sent, what lands in the project, and
  what the person is told when it fails. CI runs them with no key.
- **What the real service did**, in the description: the commands you ran with your own key, what they printed, and
  a sample of what it made (an audio file, a picture). **Never a key**: not in the code, the tests, the description
  or a screenshot. We do not ask for one.
- **Its mark** in [lib/provider-marks.ts](packages/openfilm/studio/ui/src/lib/provider-marks.ts), from
  [Lobe Icons](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-icons) or [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org) (a test holds every
  provider to having one).
- **Every word it shows in Studio** in all five languages: en, zh-CN, ja, ko and es. A key in a format of its own
  (a region with it, say) says so where it is pasted.
- **A changeset**.

Maintainers try a provider with their own key when they have one; otherwise it is merged on its tests and on what you
showed. When a service changes and its provider breaks, whoever added it is asked first.

## Pull requests

Keep each one to one change, with a test when it fixes a bug. `pnpm test` and `pnpm typecheck` must pass on macOS,
Windows and Linux (CI runs all three, and all three must pass), and `pnpm audit:public` must find nothing. A
maintainer reviews every pull request, and may ask for changes. It is squash-merged, so its title becomes the
commit's: name the part and the change, as the history does (`Studio: …`, `CLI: …`, `Desktop: …`). Add a changeset
when the change ships (above, Releases).
