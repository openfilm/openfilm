 *   desktop:chat:sessions  { project, sessions, last }
 *   desktop:chat:turn      { project, turn, items }
 *   desktop:chat:log       { project, turnId, unless? } → { file, cut, size, callsSize, events, calls } | { same } | null
 *                          a turn of another agent with no model log yet (running, or from before there was one) has
 *                          its requests read from the agent's own record (or log) as it is now (agent-records.mjs)
 *   desktop:chat:reveal    { project, turnId? }   the turn's log (or the logs folder) in the file manager
 *   desktop:chat:ref-image { project, turnId, n, bytes } → { path }   a reference's picture, kept for the agent
 *   desktop:chat:attachment { project, name, bytes } → { path }   a file pasted into a message, kept for the agent
 *   desktop:chat:paths     { paths } → [{ path, folder, size? } | { path, error }]   files and folders dragged in
 *   desktop:chat:unsaved   { project, except? } → [{ turnId, events }]   turns with a log and no saved record
 *   desktop:chat:snapshot  { project, turnId }     the project's files as a turn starts (file-changes.mjs), kept here
 *   desktop:chat:changes   { project, turnId } → { files, cut, filmLost? } | null   what the turn changed in them since
 *   desktop:chat:restore-film { project, turnId } → { ok } | { ok: false, code: 'exists' | 'gone' }   film.html put
 *                          back as that turn found it, when the turn ended with it gone (`filmLost`)
 *   desktop:prefs          → { developer, changes } and `desktop:prefs:set` either; told on `desktop:prefs`
 *
 * `project` is a folder path, and only one Studio has as a project is read or written: the page cannot point the
 * app at any other folder.
